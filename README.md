###  Live Demo Video
**Important**: A demonstration video is included in this repository showing the game in real-time action.

**To view the video:**
1. **Download the video file** from the repository
2. **Open it directly on your laptop** - do not view through GitHub's web interface
3. **View as raw file** for proper playback and real-time demonstration

*The video showcases the complete gameplay, hardware interactions, LED responses, and sound effects in real-time.*
